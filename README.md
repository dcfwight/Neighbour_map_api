 Neighbours
 ==========
## Neighbourhood map project for Udacity FSWD
### Author - Doug Wight - dcfwight@gmail.com

### Description
This is a website, using knocknout, googlemaps API, foursquare API and javascript.

### Module Build



### Setup
Clone / copy the code from github to your local computer

You then need to build the dependent modules to allow the app to work.

This project uses Bower to build the front-end javascript modules required for
the project.

You will need to build these using [Bower](https://bower.io/).

If you don't have Bower, install it using [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/), or other package manager

To install Bower (globally) using npm, enter the following into your terminal:
`npm install -g bower`

Next, to use Bower to install the modules listed in the bower.json file, run the following code from
the directory holding index.html:
`bower install`


### Launching
Once the modules have loaded, launch index.html in the browser of your choice.


### Attributions
The code from Udacity lectures and example code from [googlemaps](https://developers.google.com/maps/) have been used extensively.

### Notes on API links
The main API link is with googlemaps. It uses the places library to extract information as well.
The foursquare API is used, just for the restaurants. It gives an indication of how expensive the restaurant is.
